# ai-journey

Welcome!

I'm currently transitioning into AI with a background in frontend dev, Unity and product.

This repo is a public record of the things I am learning in AI. Most of what I commit here will come from my practice sessions. These will include small projects, experiments, model-building exercises, and more. The goal is to stay consistent, show my process, and grow in public.
